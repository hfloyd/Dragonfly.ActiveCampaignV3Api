# Dragonfly.ActiveCampaignV3Api TO-DO LIST #

This list is based on the [ActiveCampaign API Documentation](https://developers.activecampaign.com/reference).

## How to Understand this Document ##
The 'Features' section lists all the API functions available, with links to the AC documentation for each. For in-progress models, the features are organized, with references to the 'Request' implementation code files which have been set up. 

Icons and notes explain the current status of each feature:
- âœ” = The implementation is complete
- ðŸ›  = Implementation in progress
- âš  = Some issues need to be resolved (most likely due to not having enough functionality in my account for testing)
